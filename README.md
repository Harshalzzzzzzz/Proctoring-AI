## How to use?

1) Clone the repository

2) Move to the directory

3) To infer on an image that is stored on your local machine
```
python3 yolo.py --image-path='/path/to/image/'
```
4) To infer on a video that is stored on your local machine
```
python3 yolo.py --video-path='/path/to/video/'
```
5) To infer real-time on webcam
```
python3 yolo.py
```

Note: This works considering you have the `weights` and `config` files at the yolov3-coco directory.
<br/>
If the files are located somewhere else then mention the path while calling the `yolov3.py`. For more details
```
yolo.py --help
```
